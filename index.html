      <h1>Welcome to Reboot! ⚡</h1>
      <h2>Reboot is an event series and newsletter that convenes book-lovers, writers, and technologists to imagine the future of tech, humanity, and power.  </h2> 
       <p> We believe that technology must be analyzed in context with the institutions and ideologies it was borne from. To this end, we host author events alongside a weekly newsletter featuring book reviews and short essays by Reboot community members. Every newsletter also includes microdoses, the best links we’ve seen that week. 
        <p>Think Silicon Valley meets The Paris Review meets 21st century attention spans.</p>
